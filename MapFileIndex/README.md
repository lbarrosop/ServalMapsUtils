# Serval Maps Utilities #

These Serval Maps Utilities are small applications that have been developed to make it easier for the [Serval Maps] team to work with data related to Serval Maps. 

There are two applications at the moment, with others being added as the need arises. 

More information is available on the [Serval Maps Wiki][Serval Maps]

## Map File Index ##

The intention of the Map File Index application is to create an index file of a series of map data files. The index file contains metadata about each map file in the dataset as well as information about the index itself. 

The index file will be used with the Serval Maps Download service (currently being developed) which will act as a repository of [OpenStreetMap] data encoded in the [mapsforge] format.
