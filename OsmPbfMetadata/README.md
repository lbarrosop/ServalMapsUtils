# Serval Maps Utilities #

These Serval Maps Utilities are small applications that have been developed to make it easier for the [Serval Maps] team to work with data related to Serval Maps. 

There are two applications at the moment, with others being added as the need arises. 

More information is available on the [Serval Maps Wiki][Serval Maps]

## OSM PBF Metadata ##

The intention of the OSM PBF Metadata application is to output metadata related to an [OpenStreetMap] data file in the [PBF] format. Currently the bounding box and the file size are reported. 

The application can process a single file, or alternatively the application will recursively search through a directory looking for data files.
